# DSA2021G43-Ambulane-Management-System

The application stores data in CSV files and operates on different data structures such as queues, stacks, and dictionaries. It serves two types of users: callers and the management of call centers, employees, and ambulances.

Caller functionality: Allows callers to make requests to their nearest call center for emergency medical assistance.

Employee Management: Allows to manage employee including adding, deleting and updating employees.

Call center management: Enables call center management to oversee and manage call centers, their employees, and ambulances.

Data storage: Stores data in CSV files, providing a convenient and portable storage solution.
